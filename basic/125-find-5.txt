# Command to find all files under "~/tmp" directory that have been modified greater or equal than 2 days ago.

find ~/tmp -type f -mtime +1

# Explanation:  
# - 'find' searches for files in the specified directory.
# - '~/tmp' is the directory to search in.
# - '-type f' ensures only files are searched.
# - '-mtime +1' searches for files modified more than 1 day ago (i.e., at least 2 days ago).

# End of file
