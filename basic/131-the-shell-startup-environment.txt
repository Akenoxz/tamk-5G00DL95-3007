# Two environment variables from the Bash manual are $HOME and $PATH.

# 1. To use and set these environment variables:

# - $HOME: This variable represents the current user's home directory. It can be used by referencing $HOME in commands, e.g., `cd $HOME` takes you to the home directory. 
# To set $HOME permanently, you can add `export HOME=/path/to/directory` to the ~/.bashrc file.

# - $PATH: This variable contains a list of directories that are searched for executable files. 
# To set $PATH permanently, you can add `export PATH=$PATH:/new/path` to the ~/.bashrc file. 
# This will add '/new/path' to the existing list of directories in the $PATH.

# 2. To store the settings permanently for the next login sessions:
# - Open the ~/.bashrc file in an editor, for example, using `nano ~/.bashrc`.
# - Add the export commands for $HOME and $PATH to the file.
# - After making the changes, run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply them immediately. The changes will be stored permanently for future sessions.

# End of file
