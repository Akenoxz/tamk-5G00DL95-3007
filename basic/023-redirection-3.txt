# Answer to exercise "2.3 Redirection 3"  
#  
# Anything with '#' is a comment.  
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own  

# The file "2" is empty because "echo 2" sends "2" to standard output,  
# but "2> 2" redirects standard error (file descriptor 2) to file "2".  
# Since there is no error, nothing is written to "2".  

echo 2 2> 2  

# End of file
