# Answer to exercise "14.1 User command 1"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own

# To create the "_lsd" command that displays only directories, we can add the following line to the ~/.bashrc file:
# `alias _lsd='ls -d */'`
# This command lists only directories in the current working directory. 
# The "-d" option ensures that only directories are listed, and "*/" restricts the listing to directories.

# After adding the line, save and close the file. 
# To apply the changes, run: `source ~/.bashrc`

# End of file
