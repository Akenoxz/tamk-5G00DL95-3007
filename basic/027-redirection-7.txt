# Anything with '#' is a comment.  
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own  

cat file << EOF 1> file2  
hello  
EOF  

# Explanation:  
# This command uses a here-document (<< EOF) to provide input to "cat".  
# The "hello" string is passed to "cat" and redirected to "file2".  
# However, the "1>" syntax is misplaced.  
# The correct form should be:  
# cat << EOF > file2  

# End of file
