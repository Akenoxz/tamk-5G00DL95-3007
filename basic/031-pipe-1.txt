# Answer to exercise "3.1 Pipe 1"  
#  
# Anything with '#' is a comment.  
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own  

# The nonsense commands are:  
# 1. cat file | ls > file  
# 4. ls | less > cat file  

# Explanation:  
# 1. "cat file | ls > file" makes no sense because "cat file" outputs  
#    the file’s contents, which is piped to "ls", but "ls" doesn’t take input from stdin.  
# 4. "ls | less > cat file" is incorrect because "less" is an interactive pager  
#    and cannot be redirected this way.  

# End of file
