# Answer to exercise "14.3 User command 3"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own

# To create the "_ps" command that uses ps(1) to display only your processes, we can add the following line to the ~/.bashrc file:
# `alias _ps='ps -u $USER'`
# This command lists only the processes that belong to the current user by using the "-u" option and passing the $USER variable. 
# The $USER variable represents the username of the currently logged-in user.

# After adding the line, save and close the file. 
# To apply the changes, run: `source ~/.bashrc`

# End of file
