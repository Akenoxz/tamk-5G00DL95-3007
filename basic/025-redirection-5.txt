# Answer to exercise "2.5 Redirection 5"  
#  
# Anything with '#' is a comment.  
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own  

# "< /var/log/dpkg.log less"  
# This command redirects the contents of "/var/log/dpkg.log" to standard input of "less".  
# "less" then paginates the file for viewing. Equivalent to:  

less /var/log/dpkg.log  

# End of file
