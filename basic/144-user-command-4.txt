# Answer to exercise "14.4 User command 4"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own

# To create the "_lsize" command that sorts a file size listing ("ls -la") in ascending order, we can add the following line to the ~/.bashrc file:
# `alias _lsize='ls -la | sort -k 5n'`
# This command lists all files with detailed information (including size) and then sorts them by the 5th column (file size) in ascending order using the "sort" command with the "-k 5n" option.

# After adding the line, save and close the file. 
# To apply the changes, run: `source ~/.bashrc`

# End of file
