# Anything with '#' is a comment.  
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own  

echo "The Result of this command is $(ls -la | wc -l) "  

# Explanation:  
# 1. "ls -la" lists all files (including hidden ones) with details.  
# 2. "wc -l" counts the number of lines in the output.  
# 3. "$( ... )" replaces itself with the result of the command inside.  
# 4. "echo" prints: "The Result of this command is X", where X is the line count.  

# End of file
