# Answer to exercise "13.2 The Shell prompt"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own

# To set the prompt as specified in the exercise, we modify the PS1 variable in the ~/.bashrc file.

# 1. Open the ~/.bashrc file using an editor like nano:
#    `nano ~/.bashrc`
# 2. Add the following line to set the prompt format:
#    `export PS1='[\u \! \A] \w$ '`
#    Explanation of components:
#    - \u: displays the username
#    - \!: displays the history number of the current command
#    - \A: displays the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
#    - \w: displays the current working directory
#    - $: displays the prompt character (usually $ for regular users)

# 3. After adding the line, save and close the file.
# 4. To apply the changes immediately, run:
#    `source ~/.bashrc`

# End of file
