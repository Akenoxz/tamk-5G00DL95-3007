# The answer appears in line(s) of their own  

touch ls  
ls < ls > ls  

# Explanation:  
# "touch ls" creates an empty file named "ls".  
# "ls < ls > ls" attempts to use "ls" as input for "ls"  
# while also redirecting the output to "ls".  
# Since "ls" is empty, the output is also empty,  
# effectively clearing the file.  

# End of file
