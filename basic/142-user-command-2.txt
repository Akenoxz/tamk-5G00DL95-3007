# Answer to exercise "14.2 User command 2"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own

# To create the "_lsf" command that displays only files, we can add the following line to the ~/.bashrc file:
# `alias _lsf='ls -p | grep -v /'`
# This command lists all files in the current directory and filters out directories using "grep -v /". 
# The "-p" option adds a slash (/) to the end of directory names, which allows us to exclude directories.

# After adding the line, save and close the file. 
# To apply the changes, run: `source ~/.bashrc`

# End of file
